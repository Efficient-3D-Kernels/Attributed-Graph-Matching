"""
Shortest-Path Graph Kernel
--------------------------

Computes a normalized shortest-path kernel similarity between
two NetworkX graphs.

The kernel compares the distributions of shortest-path lengths
between node pairs.

For weighted graphs, edge weights are used as distances.

Output:
    similarity : normalized similarity in [0, 1]
